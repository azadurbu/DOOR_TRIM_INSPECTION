# DOOR_TRIM_INSPECTION

**Automotive Door Trim Vision Inspection System**

A modern vision-based inspection platform for verifying door trim assembly accuracy in automotive manufacturing.

DOOR_TRIM_INSPECTION is a real-time camera-driven inspection system that automatically checks screws, plugs, speakers, fasteners, pads, and other components installed on a vehicle’s door trim. Built using **C#, WPF, OpenCVSharp, and Cognex vision tools**, the system integrates with **PLC signals** to control the production line, ensuring fast, reliable, and model-specific inspection results—reporting **OK** or **NG** based on precise visual criteria. Designed for high-volume production environments, it improves quality, reduces manual errors, and maintains consistency across all inspected door trims.

## 📌 Overview of Real-Time Inspection Process

1. **PLC Signal Input**

   * The system receives a **start signal from the PLC** indicating that a door trim has been placed in the machine by the operator.

2. **Operator Placement**

   * The operator positions the door trim onto the door holder inside the inspection machine.

3. **Lighting & Camera Triggering**

   * Once the door trim is in position, the machine turns on the proper inspection lights.
   * Two cameras capture images of both sides of the door trim.

4. **Image Acquisition & Processing**

   * Captured images are sent to the vision system (OpenCVSharp + Cognex).
   * Pre-processing includes ROI cropping, noise reduction, thresholding, edge detection, and color enhancement.

5. **Component Inspection**

   * Each component is inspected based on the selected model’s recipe:

     * Screws → presence, orientation, proper seating
     * Plugs → handle/control connectors
     * Speaker → presence and shape
     * Fasteners/Clips → presence and alignment
     * Pads / Foam → correct placement
     * Model-specific components

6. **Decision & Output**

   * If all components pass → **OK**
   * If any component fails → **NG**
   * The result is displayed on the monitor in real-time.

7. **PLC Signal Output**

   * The system sends an **OK/NG signal back to the PLC** to control downstream processes (e.g., conveyor movement, sorting, alarms).

8. **Logging**

   * All inspection results, timestamps, model info, and captured images are saved in `/Log/` for traceability.

## 📄 Example Inspection Logic (C#)

```csharp
public InspectionResult Run(Bitmap leftSide, Bitmap rightSide, Recipe recipe)
{
    var result = new InspectionResult();

    result.Screw = ScrewCheck(leftSide, recipe.ScrewRoi) &&
                   ScrewCheck(rightSide, recipe.ScrewRoi);
    result.Plug = PlugCheck(leftSide, recipe.PlugRoi) &&
                  PlugCheck(rightSide, recipe.PlugRoi);
    result.Speaker = SpeakerCheck(leftSide, recipe.SpeakerRoi) &&
                     SpeakerCheck(rightSide, recipe.SpeakerRoi);
    result.Fastener = FastenerCheck(leftSide, recipe.FastenerRoi) &&
                      FastenerCheck(rightSide, recipe.FastenerRoi);
    result.Pad = PadCheck(leftSide, recipe.PadRoi) &&
                 PadCheck(rightSide, recipe.PadRoi);

    result.Overall = result.AllPass() ? "OK" : "NG";

    // Send result to PLC
    PLC.SendSignal(result.Overall);

    // Save inspection logs
    Logger.Save(result, leftSide, rightSide);
    return result;
}
```
